The Value of Early Walking after Surgery
Early walking after surgery is one of the most crucial things you can do to prevent problems.
Your doctor will order the activity that is best for you.
Starting to Walk after Surgery
While in bed, leg pumps will be applied to help promote blood flow in your legs. When it is
time to get out of bed, your nursing staff (nurse or nursing assistant) will help you:
• Dangle at the bedside.
• Move from the bed to a chair.
• Walk in the hallways.
You may feel dizzy or faint when first getting up, so you must go slowly at first. This means
sitting up slowly and sitting at the side of the bed for a few minutes.
Please let the nursing staff know if you feel faint, dizzy, nauseated, or are short of breath while
walking.
Why should you walk?
Walking promotes the flow of oxygen throughout your body and maintains normal breathing
function. It also strengthens your muscle tone. Gastrointestinal and urinary tract function are
improved by walking. These body systems are slowed down after surgery. Walking also
improves blood flow and speeds wound healing.
Failure to walk may cause increased constipation and gas pain, weakness, less power to fight
infections, and puts you at a higher risk for blood clots and lung problems such as pneumonia.
Prolonged bed rest may also increase the risk for skin breakdown and pressure sores.
