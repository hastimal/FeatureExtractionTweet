The Nursing Outcome Classification, a standardized method of medical terminology recognized by nurses and medical professionals throughout the world, defines ambulation as the ability to walk from place to place independently with or without assistive device. Ambulation includes everything from standing to walking to positioning and even transfers to and from medical facilities.
Greeley HC Pro has identified a few of the benefits of ambulation as the following:
•    Strengthened muscles
•    Increased joint flexibility
•    Stimulated circulation
•    Osteoporosis prevention
•    Pressure relief for the body and skin
•    Improved self-esteem and feelings of independence
•    Additional social activity
As a member of the NurseCore family, a few of those benefits really jump out. Fitting directly in line with NurseCore’s mantra of providing AWESome service, ambulation should be seen as an invaluable tool for homecare providers, helping in two key areas: 1) Increased Flexibility and Muscle Rehabilitation and 2) Additional Social Activity
Increased Flexibility and Muscle Rehabilitation
Patients suffering from muscle weakness as a result of a surgery or a stroke should view ambulation as one of the best ways to help build back strength. The physical therapy that precedes ambulation can tremendously help a patient in recuperating lost muscle capacity. Repeated action, like ambulation, is an easy way to build muscle endurance and strength, particularly in the abdomen and legs.
Additional Social Activity
“Aging is the process – boredom is the danger,” reads an article from Parentgiving.com on helping elderly loved ones maintain a high quality of life. But whether the patient is a senior citizen, an individual stricken with an illness or a child coping with disability, boredom is the enemy of a life filled with happiness and joy.
Here are just a few of the emotional issues boredom can lead to: feelings of worthlessness, intense restlessness and unloved or uncared about. Ambulation not only helps build physical strength but has a number of physiological benefits as well – it stimulates the brain and promotes social interaction.
In 2011, researchers even found that socially active elderly people were two times more likely to avoid disabilities pertaining to daily activities when compared to people who not socially active.
While the threat of an ill-fated fall will always exist, the benefits of ambulation, particularly for patients suffering from arthritis or recovering from surgery, should never be discounted. You can focus on the positive benefits and help reduce the possibility of an unfortunate fall by removing any and all items that may present themselves as obstacles and ensure that the patient is wearing appropriate, supportive shoes or footwear.
