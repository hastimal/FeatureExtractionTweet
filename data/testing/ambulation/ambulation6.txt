EARLY AMBULATION in abdominal surgery is not a new procedure. It
dates from a paper of Ries1, in I899. It is really as old as abdominal surgery,
however, for Ephriam McDowell after the first ovariotomy on Jane Todd
Crawford found her up and making her bed on the fifth postoperative day.
The method found rather wide acceptance in European clinics,2-4-'3'4
16-20-21- 23-27 but made no substantial progress in this country until the last six
years. Recent reviews by Leithauser35 and Newburger36 and articles by
Powers,'5 Schafer and Dragstedt,5I and Elman,42 as well as others,3132
38-40-41- 2-48-49-50-56-61_62_6 b5 have focussed attention on the subject. Nevertheless,
there still persists a certain deep-rooted scepticism.
On examining the issue, it is apparent that the chief purpose of bed rest
following abdominal surgery is to put the affected parts at rest. This is
based on the conviction that inactivity is necessary for optimal wound healing.
To secure this advantage it is necessary to accept the disadvantage of
prolonged bed rest. Much attention has been directed at various physiologic
aspects of the problem. In the recumbent position there is a decrease in
vital capacity, and this is further augmented after abdominal operations54
by a decrease in diaphragmatic function and a relative fixation of the diaphragm
in a high position. 1loreover, the horizontal position55 greatly
decreases the efficiency of the cough reflex. Under such circumstances some
degree of atelectasis is inevitable. The influence of atelectasis, and its amelioration
by early ambulation has been studied by Schafer and Dragstedt.51
They approached the problem by comparing the postoperative temperature
curves of 4o early-rising patients, and ioo traditionally bed-confined patients.
In practically every instance the early risers had a lower temperature
elevation and resumed a normal temperature level sooner than did the
bed-confined patients. The assumption of the standing position and the
downward pull of the abdominal contents lowers the diaphragm and increases
the efficiency of the cough reflex. Coughing in the standing position
will almost invariably expel the mucus and aerate the collapsed areas.

Leithauser35 has shown that with early rising the vital capacity returns
to normal in half the time required by the bed-confined postoperative
patients.
Backer-Grondahl53 followed the spirometric curve of 24 patients upon
whom gastric resection was performed for ulcer and found that in the earlv
risers the spirometric curve returned to normal much sooner. His pulmonary
complications in a large series were reduced to one-third of their former
frequency. In Russia, Kimbarovskiy20 decreased pulmonary complications
from both gynecologic and gastric operations to approximately one-tenth
through early rising. In this country a reduction in pulmonary complications
has been noted by practically all who have considered the subjeCt33-
35-44-45-51. 52-61
In the uncomplicated postoperative state there is an impairment of the
circulatory reflexes necessary to the maintenance of the erect position. This
results in cerebral anemia, with its familiar symptoms of faintness, giddiness,
visual disturbances, palpitation and deepened respiration. The physiologic
mechanisms involved in this syndrome are complex and have been studied
extensively as a part of the war program on convalescence and rehabilitation.
Among them are a diminished cardiac output,57-58-59-60 a venous pressure
deficit, a blood volume deficit and a decrease in the reserve of the venopressor
mechanism. Among the prime causes of this physiologic disturbance
is recumbency. The longer it persists, the slower the convalescence. Early
resumption of the upright position produces a rapid return of the circulation
to normal and is the secret of early postoperative fitness.
A diminished venous return and stasis in the deep veins of the leg are
of prime importance in the development of postoperative thrombo-embolic
phenomena. There are other elements to be considered, however, such as
avoidance of trauma to veins, infection, alterations in the blood, as well as
climatic and seasonal influences. Tlhromiibo-embolism starts early, and for
ambulation to be effective it must be early and active, that is, within the first
24 hours. In any series of cases there are some in which this cannot be accomplished.
For this reason, early ambulation cannot entirely eliminate
tlirombo-embolic disease. The extensive literature8-24-25- 29-30-35- 37-39-44-45-47-61-62-
64 on this subject indicates that it probably reduces its incidence. This conclusion
may be debatable, however, and final judgment must rest on a statistical
analysis of controlled material.
The fear of faulty wound healing is the greatest deterrent to the acceptance
of early ambulation. All authors are clear and definite that woundhealing
is not impaired and there are many suggestions that it is improved.
Ries' says: " . . . and I have yet to see the first hernia." Leithauser33 had
no dehiscence or postoperative hernia in 436 cases. In his later report,35
dehiscence, incisional hernia and recurrences following herniorrhaphy were
not more frequent after early rising. There was no instance of eventration
in the goo cases. In 462 abdominal incisions Nelson43 had three partial disruptions,
two of which occurred in patients whose wounds had been closed

with catgut and for whom early ambulation had not been authorized.
Powers45 allowed 39 herniae to rise early, and none recurred. In 39 controls
treated by the traditional method of bed rest there were two recurrences.
Ashkins47 noted one bulging cholecystectomy wound and one weak scar,
witlhout protrusion, in 823 cases; Schafer and Dragstedt51 in I02 cases had
one eventration and two postoperative herniae. Elman52 had no wound disruptions
in 79 cases, but noted three in his control group. Many others
testify in the same vein.3' 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 17, 18, 19, 22, 26, 28
From an experimental point of view, Newburger36 produced standardized
celiotomy wounds in rats and at intervals of 3-5-IO days the strength of the
wounds was determined in animals which were kept at rest and in others
which were exercised. Exercise rather than immobilization was found to
lhasten the increase in tissue strength of the experimental abdominal incisioni.
The Russian, Kimbarovskiy29 studied wounds in dogs in the ambulant
state and dogs forced into the reclining position by means of plaster enlcasements.
In the restricted animal he concluded there was a decrease in
fibroplasia.
The experience and data presented in this paper cover all cases admitted
to the Surgical Service at the Brooke General Hospital, Fort Sam Houstonl,
Texas, during the period September I, I94.3 to August i, I945. This was one
of the larger Army General Hospitals and was situated on a permanent post.
The material was predominantly military but there is included a very sizable
number of veterans, dependents and retired personnel. The plan of
early ambulation in this hospital was inaugurated by Brigadier General
James Bethea during his tour as Chief of the Surgical Service. He was
succeeded by Doctor J. M. Foster who continued these policies until he was
relieved on the activation of the Colorado Unit.
All cases were under our direct supervision or personal care. The Service
was so arranged that each case was seen each day by one of us during tlle
immediate postoperative period. All were carefully examined on discharge.
The data were obtained from the statistical records of the Surgical Service
and from various personal notes and memoranda.
In all, there were 2827 abdominal cases. Nine hundred and nineteen of
these were some variety of hernia. All herniae were treated by early ambulation
from September i, I942 to July 13, I943. During this period the policy
was highly satisfactory and no ill effects were noted. Only one recurrence
was noted at the Hospital. Two others were reported by letter. The exact
date of recurrence in these cases can never be determined. Certainly, none
recurred within six weeks after operation. There were no wound complications
attributable to the policy. It is felt, but not known, that the eventual
percentage of recurrences would be considered satisfactory. The policy of
early ambulation in the treatment of inguinal hernia was discontinued by the
Surgeon-General in a directive dated July I3, 1943.
The remaining I908 cases comprised a representative group of abdominal
cases.

BURCJH AND FISHER Aiiiials of utirgery
Unless there were specific contraindications, such as. shock, extreme
debility, severe generalized peritonitis or an insecure wound, all cases were
mobilized on the first postoperative day. The procedure was generally wellliked
and accepted by all classes of patients. From the general point of view
it was obvious that the morale of these patients was excellent and the effect
of this on the preoperative cases was to remove much of the dread and fear
of surgery.
There was a notable absence of bladder and bowel inertia and the problem
of nursing was greatly simplified. After three to four days the average
patient was pretty well able to look after himself and even to wait on the more
recently operated upon. We have no record of the number of minor wound
complications. Major wound complications were notable only by their
absence.
It is definite that there was but one eventration. This occurred in an
obese individual with intractable hiccough. There are records of four postoperative
herniae -one following hysterectomy, one after the closure of a
colostomy; one following nephrectomy and one at the site of a marsupialized
pancreatic cyst.
A few mild cases of superficial thrombophlebitis were seen, and most
were attributed to the practice of using a foot vein for the intra-operative administration
of fluids. There were no cases of femoral or iliac thrombophlebitis.
Two patients died from pulmonary embolism. One of these occurred
67 days postoperatively in a malnourished individual who had a
stormy convalescence after a posterior gastro-enterostomy for duodenal ulcer.
There is some evidence that this was related to an infusion of amigen into a
leg vein. The other occurred in a young veteran with an inoperable retroperitoneal
tumor. He was ambulant on the first postoperative day and had
a normal course until he suddenly died on the tenth postoperative day with
the classic symptoms of embolism. An autopsy was refused.
In conclusion, our experience, as well as the cumulative recorded experience
of many surgeons, testifies to the physiologic soundness of early
postoperative ambulation. It is a proved procedure of great benefit to patients
and is deserving of a much wider employment.

DIscuSSION.-DR. BRADLEY L. COLEY, New York City: The subject of early rising
after surgical operations has been of great interest to me, and I feel we should be
grateful to Doctor Burch for having presented his views and his experience while he
was Chief of the Surgical Service at Brooke General Hospital. I can say, without
hesitation, that his conclusions as to the advantages of early ambulation were borne
out by the experience of other surgeons in the Eighth Service Command, where it was
my privilege to serve for nearly three years. I should like to take up just one phase
of the subject; namely, the effect of early ambulation on reduction of the incidence
of phlebothrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
In the autumn of I944 we surveyed the large Station, Regional and General
Hospitals in the Eighth Service Command and collected the cases which had accumulated
up to that time. Thirty hospitals reported a total of I53 instances of phlebothrombosis,
with 54 pulmonary embolisms and nine deaths. In none of these cases
had the patient been an early riser. Later, I did learn of an appendix patient allowed
up early who developed a nonfatal embolism on the I4th day after operation.
While it seems clear that ambulation will not eliminate this dreaded complication
of surgery, it is our opinion that it should do much to reduce its frequency.
Doctor Burch spoke of the directive which prevented us from adopting early
ambulation in hernia patients. For the past six months on Dr. Carl Burdick's
service at the Hospital for Special Surgery, we have made it a rule to allow all our
hernia patients out of bed on the day after the operation. These cases include large
incisional, umbilical, recurrent inguinal and femoral herniae. When suifficient time
has elapsed to permit us to draw conclusions we will report our experience. Suffice
it to say, however, that the immediate results have been gratifying to us and to the
patients. Were we not using nonabsorbable suture material throughout, we would
not have the assurance that the early rising of these patients is an entirely safe
procedure.
A word of caution is timely. The mere fact that the patient with an abdominal
operation is allowed to leave his bed and walk about does not imply that his activities
can be unrestricted. He must be cautioned as to what he can safely do and what he
must avoid, lest he place undue strain on his as yet unhealed incision.
If early ambulation is practiced intelligently it seems that it is a sane, a safe and
a beneficial method of postoperative management.
DR. HERMAN E. PEARSE, Rochester, N. Y.: About a year ago I had the privilege
of visiting some hospitals in Texas with Colonel Burch, and at that time learned of
his results. I was greatly impressed then, as I am now. The method was not unfamiliar,
for some of you may remember that some time ago Doctor Morton advocated
early ambulation in older patients. We must admit to a certain amount of
mental lethargy in not adopting this for younger, healthier patients. The fear of
wound disruption by early ambulation is a myth, handed down to us from the past.
A wound may be disrupted by involuntary action such as coughing, sneezing, or
vomiting or by pressure from distention. It is not disrupted by voluntary effort, for
