Recovery
Recovery from knee arthroscopy is much faster than recovery from traditional open knee surgery. Still, it is important to follow your orthopaedic surgeon's instructions carefully after you return home. You should ask someone to check on you the first evening you are home.

Swelling

Keep your leg elevated as much as possible for the first few days after surgery. Apply ice as recommended by your doctor to relieve swelling and pain.

Dressing Care
You will leave the hospital with a dressing covering your knee. Keep your incisions clean and dry. Your surgeon will tell you when you can shower or bathe, and when you should change the dressing.

Your surgeon will see you in the office a few days after surgery to check your progress, review the surgical findings, and begin your postoperative treatment program.

Bearing Weight
Most patients need crutches or other assistance after arthroscopic surgery. Your surgeon will tell you when it is safe to put weight on your foot and leg. If you have any questions about bearing weight, call your surgeon.

Driving
Your doctor will discuss with you when you may drive. This decision is based on a number of factors, including:

The knee involved
Whether you drive an automatic or stick shift
The nature of the procedure
Your level of pain
Whether you are using narcotic pain medications
How well you can control your knee.
Typically, patients are able to drive from 1 to 3 weeks after the procedure.

Medications
Your doctor will prescribe pain medication to help relieve discomfort following your surgery. He or she may also recommend medication such as aspirin to lessen the risk of blood clots.

Exercises to Strengthen Your Knee

You should exercise your knee regularly for several weeks after surgery. This will restore motion and strengthen the muscles of your leg and knee.

Therapeutic exercise will play an important role in how well you recover. A formal physical therapy program may improve your final result.

Outcome
Unless you have had a ligament reconstruction, you should be able to return to most physical activities after 6 to 8 weeks, or sometimes much sooner. Higher impact activities may need to be avoided for a longer time. You will need to talk with your doctor before returning to intense physical activities.

If your job involves heavy work, it may be longer before you can return to your job. Discuss when you can safely return to work with your doctor.

The final outcome of your surgery will likely be determined by the degree of damage to your knee. For example, if the articular cartilage in your knee has worn away completely, then full recovery may not be possible.You may need to change your lifestyle. This might mean limiting your activities and finding low-impact exercise alternative.
